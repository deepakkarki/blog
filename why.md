##What
This repository is my collection of ideas and blog posts on programming and technology. Every blog post is essentially a plain text markdown file in the root folder of this git repository. Hopefully I will find a sane way of displaying and ordering all posts on the README page.

##Why
I am very well aware of github pages - the free web hosting service provided by Github. But I've had my fare share of problems with that. I've used jekyll, octopress and pelican, but have not been happy with any of them. Either customizations take too much time or require me to write a plugin. Octopress used to conk out randomly while pushing upstream. I also ended fussing too much over how my blog looked rather than actually blogging. Finally I may not have my dev setup where ever I go, and I don't want to be restricted because I'm not carrying my laptop with me. All I want to do at the end of the day is put my ideas out onto the web, not manage a static site generator.

Reasons I'm using this repository : 

* I can focus on content, not worry about how my blog looks or how it will be hosted.
* I can write markdown and get a live preview in browser.
* Greater visisbility. Chances are people will find this repository, not my blog.
* Plain old git repo => write from anywhere, naturally portable.
* I can now literally drag and drop a file into this repo :)
